Last week I was in texas for three days and one of my biggest takeaways from visiting some of the best in the country is that I am definitely pulling way too early and was too afraid to bump the temperature. 

Most of the best places I went to did 250 and bumped to 300 after wrapping until they felt good. I didnâ€™t understand this at first but I realized that a lot of what I used to think was the meat drying out in places I didnâ€™t like what actually the meat not fully breaking down so it was tough and when its tough the juices canâ€™t get in. 

So the idea here is to basically replicate what I did last time with the wood and foil boat for good bark but then pull much later at like 203 and see how it turns out. Because I completely failed at the cold smoke last time Iâ€™m not even gonna try that and just rock with 220-250 til its time to boat and bump it up to 250. 

Honesty after pulling this thing this is the best brisket I have ever made. Super super tender, best bark Iâ€™ve gotten yet. I still donâ€™t have the bark because when I handle it its prone to fall off. I also think that I wasnâ€™t aggressive enough with the trimming in some areas. Anyways Iâ€™ll try to figure out how to get the bark better.
